Asset is a tool aimed at improving the process of debugging applications, especially those already built. It often happens that when testing the system in the editor's environment, everything works fine, but after recompiling to the final version, problems arise. In these situations, developers usually use a Development Build or create a simple system for logging information or detecting bugs. In some cases, certain bugs even cause the app to crash completely. In the context of virtual reality (VR) applications, creating such a debugging system and reading logs can be particularly inconvenient and roublesome. This is where the asset comes in, which uses Websocket technology to establish a connection between the client (the final build of your application) and the server. This connection allows seamless transfer of logs from the client to the server, which in turn allows for convenient reading of all information directly from the computer. The client application (final application build) and the server must be on the same network in order to connect via Websocket.
